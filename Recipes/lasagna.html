    <p>
      Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.
